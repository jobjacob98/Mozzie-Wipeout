# Mozzie-Wipeout #

Thousands of people die every year due to mosquito carried diseases like dengue and chikungunya. We developed a game to spread awareness on the ways to prevent such deadly diseases. It is a pseudo-3D PC game developed using the pygame library in Python. <br/> 
This project was done as part of Smart India Hackathon 2017 under the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).<br/>
